# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Species Prediction - Machine Learning Mini Project  

This project is a **machine learning-based classification model** that predicts the species of flowers based on input features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The dataset used is the **Iris dataset**, which contains labeled data for three flower species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.
